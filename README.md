Fairly is a talent acquisition platform that enables teams to efficiently discover and recruit high-quality and diverse talent. As an MVP, Fairly's proprietary code restricts me from sharing complete code samples, but I can provide snippets showcasing my expertise. Within this repository, you will find SQL, C#/.NET, and React code snippets demonstrating my contributions to the development of the newsletter subscription and work history features.
